### Medical Transcription Classification

The goal of this project is to develop or find high-performing NLP model that can correctly classify the medical specialties based on the transcription text with significant accuracy. 

This project was inspired by the existing Kaggle dataset [Medical Transcriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions) and [mtsamples.com](https://www.mtsamples.com/) that has a collection of transcribed medical reports (Boyle, 2019). 

This project might be useful in understanding the nature of the language used in medical transcriptions of various kinds, and this tool might be useful for other kinds of NLP data analysis involving medical transcriptions.

#### Preparation
The libraries and packages that are needed to run the code are sklearn, numpy, pandas, random, re, xgboost, keras, and collections.
